In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile app development, creating practical and user-friendly applications remains a fundamental goal. One such indispensable tool that has stood the test of time is the calculator. In this document, we delve into the world of iOS app development with a focus on Swift, a powerful and intuitive programming language. Our objective is to guide you through the process of building a simple calculator application for iOS using Swift.

Calculators are ubiquitous, and creating one from scratch can be an excellent exercise for both beginners looking to familiarize themselves with Swift and experienced developers seeking to enhance their skills. This project offers hands-on experience in designing user interfaces, implementing basic mathematical operations, handling user input, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
